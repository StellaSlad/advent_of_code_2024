Advent of Code is an annual programming challenge that takes place during the month of December. Each day, a new puzzle is released, providing a fun and engaging way to practice coding and problem-solving skills. The puzzles vary in difficulty and cover a range of topics, making it a great opportunity for both beginners and experienced programmers. 

I really enjoyed taking part in this challenge and I am excited to share my solutions. All of my solutions are written in Python. Here is the link to the challenge: https://adventofcode.com/

You can submit answers all year round, but you need to submit them as quickly as possible to be mentioned on the Leaderboard.
